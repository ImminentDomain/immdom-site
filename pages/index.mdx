# Imminent Domain (ImmDom)

some notes will go here about the problem we're solving for.
**That’s why we've build Imminent Domain** (aka - yer pal, ImmDom)

## what is it?

what's in spitting distance:
- CLI / UI deployment automation for both functions and infra

## who’s it useful for?

## why use it?

## where we're going
our intention is to make software development easier and open to more people,
and software systems more scalable and reliable.

- code once, use anywhere (google sheets, apps, etc...)
- use-case based search for functionality
- learn / build by modifying working examples
- True Software Engineering



**heavily inspired by the likes of:** Netlify and Vercel Functions, Blockspring,
Vercel's GCP integration, Gruntworks

we're always going to be free and open source, in spirit and name alike.
**we welcome you to join us in opening software development to more people**
